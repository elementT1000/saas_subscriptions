## Target Metrics and Dimensions
- **Subscription Revenue:** The total revenue generated by subscription plans across multiple segments. 
- **Plan Type:** Business, Enterprise, and Pro subscription plans.
- **Membership Period:** The duration of time that customers commit to for a subscription. 
- **Continent:** The continent in which a home address is listed for a membership.

## Summary of Insights
### Plan Type:

- During March of 2020, all plans saw a significant spike in sales (**+$1.391M in a single month**). Enterprise plans saw the largest increase in subscriptions, with a **2.64x increase in subscription revenue**. This spike can be seen in the Plan Type chart on the Tableau dashboard.
- Business plans **lost more than 15%** of their contribution to overall sales revenue in Q4 of 2021, **more than $416K in revenue**. This warrants further investigation into the competitive landscape and customer satisfaction with the features offered in this plan.

### Membership Period: 

- The year-long membership agreements captured most of the incoming sales spike during lockdowns, with a **$2.2M increase in Q2 sales revenue**.
- Year-long membership agreements have seen a **reduction in sales quarter over quarter** for all of 2021. On the other hand, monthly sales averaged **$238K/quarter in 2021, +$38K/quarter beyond 2020's performance**.

### Continent:

- North America captured most of the increase in sales revenue during Q2 2024. **Asia and Latin America** had the highest quarter-over-quarter growth rate from **Q1 to Q2 of 2024 at 144% and 150% growth**, respectively. 

## Recommendations & Next Steps
- *Plan Type*: Investigate why business plans experienced a steep decline in revenue in Q4 2021. Is there a competitor offering similar features? Has customer satisfaction with this product changed measurably within the time span of this dataset?
- *Membership Period*: Yearly commitments contribute the majority of Zoom's sales revenue. Therefore, it is critical to investigate why sales for this commitment have trended negatively while monthly plans have continued year-over-year growth.
- *Continent*: Zoom gained significant market share in Asia and Latin America during the onset of the pandemic. These markets and the customers therein should be studied so that Zoom may understand how to retain and grow this market share in the future.
